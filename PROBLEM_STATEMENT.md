PROBLEM STATEMENT
---

###Full Online MOOC System.

* You need to build a Rest API where an **instructor 
    and student manage their Webinars & Courses**.
* A Creator can create **_course_**, **_subjects_**, **_tags_** and they can upload videos and webinars to the system. 
* **_Lessons & webinars can be present in multiple courses and subjects._**
* A **_Student can_** then **_search for webinars and/or videos_** using **_webinar title, video title, course name and subject name_**, 
  * and can filter using **_course, subjects and tags_**. 
    
####Build the application keeping in mind that data duplicacy and time complexity should be minimized.
